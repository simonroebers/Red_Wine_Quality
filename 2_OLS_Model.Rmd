# OLS Models
```{r}
model1 <- lm(quality ~ alcohol + sulphates + citric.acid + 
  volatile.acidity, data=df)
model2 <- lm(quality ~ alcohol + sulphates + citric.acid + volatile.acidity + 
  sulphates*citric.acid + citric.acid*alcohol + citric.acid*volatile.acidity
  , data=df)
stargazer(model1, model2, intercept.bottom=FALSE, type='text')
```

- Base model without interaction effects shows that citric acid does not have a statistically significant impact on quality
- Second model indicates that interactions of citric acid with sulphates and alcohol are significant
- Model performance does however not increase meaningfully
- Around 33 % of variation in quality can be described with these regressions
